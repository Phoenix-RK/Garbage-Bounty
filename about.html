<h1 style=color:MidnightBlue>ABOUT US</h1>
<h1> GARBAGE BOUNTY</h1>
<br>
<h2>ADDING  WORTH TO  WASTE</h2>
<br>
<p>Garbage Bounty is developed with the motto to provide a platform to help you get useful products in return of your wastes.</p>
<p>We act as a bridge in establishing connection between the user and the supplier, wherein we focus in the mutual benefit of the two parties.</p>
<p>While the user as well as the environment is benefitted by the products sold by the seller,
<br> the seller is benefitted by the garbage he gets from the user,
<br> which he uses as his raw material, with recycling being the biggest take away.</p>
